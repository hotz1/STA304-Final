# STA304-Final
Files for a the final project for STA304 Fall 2021 at the University of Toronto.

For the final project for this course, students were required to find an ethical source of data, and to create a research question for the data which they had collected from their data source. Furthermore, students were expected to implement statistical analysis techniques which were discussed during the course in order to determine the statistical significance of their research question.

For my project, I collected data from [Pro Football Reference](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/) using the `sportsipy` Python API to determine the effects which certain changes to the NFL's rules had had on teams' offenses in the NFL. 

The data was collected using Python as shown in the .ipynb file which is attached in this repo. However, all statistical analyses were done using R, and these analyses are detailed in the RMarkdown file in this repo. This file was also 'knitted' to a PDF, which is attached to this repository, and is easier to read and digest, but does not show the code used in the analyses.

The CSV file in this repo contains the data collected using the `sportsipy` API in Python, and this file was imported directly into R for use in the analyses, as shown in the RMarkdown document.
